# Mathematical attacks on RSA

This is a survey on different attacks on a relaxed model of RSA.

First, we'll see how Coppersmith found out that you could use lattice reduction techniques to attack a relaxed RSA (we know parts of the message, or we know parts of one of the prime).

Second we'll see how Boneh and Durfee used coppersmith to factor the RSA modulus under certain assumptions.
