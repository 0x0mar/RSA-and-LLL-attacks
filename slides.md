# INTRO

* reminder on RSA:
- encrypt 
- sign

* what sorts of attack we do today:
- implementation, side-channel
- mathematical (it's hard)

* mathematical is : 
- factorize N (=pq) which allows us to recover d
- recover d directly
- recover m when we have e^m (mod N)

* so what we could do is mathematical but on relaxed RSA

# PLAN OF THE TALK:

* Hastad Broadcast Attack

* Coppersmith small roots (x < N^1/e)

* Boneh-Durfee bound (d < N^0.292)

# Hastad Broadcast attack

* explanation

* how to extend that?

# COPPERSMITH

* formulate the problem for RSA

* explanation of the idea of coppersmith attack

* high view of coppersmith technique

* lattices

* low level of coppersmith

# Boneh and Durfee
